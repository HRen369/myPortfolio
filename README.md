 # My Portfolio

--- A LOT OF THE PAGES ARE STILL IN DEVELOPLMENT

A simple website that is meant to be my portfolio. It's main objective is to give the reader a quick understanding of what I do, did and can do.

Currently there are 4 main pages. Home page gives a brief overview. The Projects page shows my previous projects or projects I'm working now. The contact page is how to contact me. In this case it would be primarly email. Lastly, is the about page. This is where I explain where I'm from and what educatiion I got. Also any facts about me.
